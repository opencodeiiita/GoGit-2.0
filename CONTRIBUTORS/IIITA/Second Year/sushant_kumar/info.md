we know that the fork and PR model is a version of git's own branch-and-merge functionality, in which commits can follow separate paths (called branches) and then be brought back together.

this is called branch and merge

step 1  first we will git checkout branch-2 

then we will commit and push our changes 

step 2. merge it to branch-1 and make a PR for original repo
